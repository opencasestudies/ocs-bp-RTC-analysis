### Title 

Influence of Multicollinearity on Measured Impact of Right-to-Carry Gun Laws Part 2

### Motivation 

The influence of the implementation of less restrictive right-to-carry gun laws on violent crime is a historically controversial topic. One reason for the contriversy, is concern that some earlier reports examing this topic may have used methods that were inappropriate. 

One of the major concerns is that an earlier report included multiple demographic variables that were collinear with one another. This resulted in different a very coefficient estimate for right-to-carry gun law adoption than other reports that did not include colinear varaibles. This phenomenon is called [multicollinearity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicollinearity), and it can result in abberant findings for particular explanatory variables, despite not altering the overall predictive power of a model.

In this case study we use data peform simplified analyses similar to those of reports on this topic to explore the influence of multicolinearity on coeffcient estimate stability. We however, do not recreate the previous analyses. The reports that we use as a guide for our analysis are:

1. John J. Donohue et al., Right‐to‐Carry Laws and Violent Crime: A Comprehensive Assessment Using Panel Data and a State‐Level Synthetic Control Analysis. *Journal of Empirical Legal Studies*, 16,2 (2019).

2. David B. Mustard & John Lott. Crime, Deterrence, and Right-to-Carry Concealed Handguns. *Coase-Sandor Institute for Law & Economics* Working Paper No. 41, (1996).

### Motivating question

1) How does the inclusion of different numbers of age groups influence the results of an analysis of right to carry laws and violence rates?

### Data   

In this case study, we perform analyses similar to those in [Donohue, et al.](https://www.nber.org/papers/w23510.pdf){target="_blank"} article and the [Lott and Mustard](https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1150&context=law_and_economics){target="_blank"} article, however **we do not try to recreate them**, instead we perform simplified analyses to allow us to focus on multicolinearity.

Therefore we use a subset of the **explanatory variables** used by each article including:   

1. Data about state demographics in terms of population compositions for age, sex, race, as well as overall population values from the US Census Bureau:

---------- |-------------
**years 1977 to 1979**  | [link](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/tables/1900-1980/state/asrh/)  
**years 1980 to 1989**  | [link](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/tables/1980-1990/counties/asrh/) * county data was used for this decade which also has state information
**years 1990 to 1999**  | [link](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/tables/1990-2000/state/asrh/)
**years 2000 to 2010**  | [link](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/popest/intercensal-2000-2010-state.html) <br> [technical documentation](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/technical-documentation/file-layouts/2000-2010/intercensal/state/st-est00int-alldata.pdf){target="_blank"}

Six demographic variables are created for the [Donohue, et al.](https://www.nber.org/papers/w23510.pdf){target="_blank"}-like analysis and 36 were created for the [Lott and Mustard](https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1150&context=law_and_economics){target="_blank"}-like analysis.

To use this data, we also need [Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) state codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Information_Processing_Standard_state_code){target="_blank", to identify what demographic data corresponds to what state. This is also available from the [US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/2014/demo/popest/2014-geocodes-state.html){target="_blank"}.

2. Police staffing data, which was downloaded from the [Federal Bureau of Investigation](https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/downloads-and-docs){target="_blank"}

3. Unemployment data, which was downloaded from the [U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/dsrv?la){target="_blank"}. 

4. Poverty data, extracted from Table 21 from this [US Census Bureau Poverty Data ](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-poverty-people.html){target="_blank"}

5. Right-to-carry law data, which is available in a table in the [Donohue paper](https://www.nber.org/papers/w23510.pdf){target="_blank"}

Finally our outcome of interest is violent crime rates. The violent crime data was downloaded from the [FBI uniform crime reporting system](https://www.ucrdatatool.gov/Search/Crime/State/StatebyState.cfm){target="_blank"}


#### Learning Objectives

The skills, methods, and concepts that students will be familiar with by the end of this case study are:

<u>**Statistical Learning Objectives:**</u> 

1) what multicollinearity is and how it can influence linear regression coefficients  
2) how to look for the presence of multicollinarity and determine the severity
3) the difference between multicollinearity and correlation 
4) implementation of panel regression analysis (`plm`)
5) calcuation of VIF (`car`)

<u>**Data science Learning Objectives:**</u>

1) data import of many different file types with special cases (`readr`, `readxl`, `pdftools`)
2) joining data from multiple sources (`dplyr`)  
3) working with character strings (`stringr`)
4) data comparisons (`dplyr` and `janitor`)
5) reshaping data into different formats (`tidyr`)  
6) visualizations (`ggplot2`) 
7) perform iterative simulations (`rsample`)


#### Data import and wrangling

See [the part 1 case study](https://github.com/opencasestudies/ocs-bp-RTC-wrangling) for the data import and data wrangling details. 

#### Data Visualization

This case study demonstrates how to make correaltion plots and scatter plots with error bars. We also show how to add formulas and arrows to plots. The instruction about data visualization assumes that students have some familiarity with `ggplot2`.

### Analysis

This case study covers balanced panel regression model data analysis with fixed effects. In doing so we provide an introduction to longitudinal analysis in general, as well as use of the `plm` package. We also show how to calculate [Variance inflation factor (VIF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance_inflation_factor) values  using the `car` package to quantify the severity of multicollinearity. As another assesment of multicollinearity, we demonstrate how to perform simulations to evaluate the stability of coefficient estimates.

#### Target audience 

For individuals or classes with some familiarity with regression. See this [case study](https://opencasestudies.github.io/ocs-bp-diet/){target="_blank"} for an introduction to regression. 

#### Suggested homework

Ask students to remove one or more of the demographic variables with high VIF values from the Lott-like panel data and perform the panel linear regression analysis again, as well as cacluate the VIF values. 

Ask the students to discuss how this possibly changed the results.
